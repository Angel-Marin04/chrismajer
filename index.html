                <div class="why-content">
                    <p>If you are looking for a nice 'happy clappy' motivational speaker you have come to the wrong place! The entire business world is in the midst of disruptive change, and this is no time to order 'vanilla' for your team. Chris isn't just a speaker; he is an experience. He will provide you and your team with a new way to see the world, new ways to achieve success, and a boost to get started on needed changes.</p>

                    <p>One of his customized keynotes will give your team plenty to think about. He knows his stuff and more importantly he knows the world of business because he has been working with top tier companies for some 30 years. Instead of some retired athlete or professor pretending to know the business world, wouldn't you rather have someone who has run a company, coached CEO's, and presided over large scale successful transformations?</p>

                    <p>The keynotes are great, but those of you who are serious about building an enduring enterprise always ask, "Then what?" If you are serious about competing for the future, Chris and his team offer a series of follow up programs for each of his bespoke core presentations that range from ½ day to 9 months and produce simply incredible results. Take a look at the core presentations, all which are tailored to your audience, and then let's get your customized program going!</p>

            <h2>CHRIS MAJER'S</h2>
            <h3 class="section-title">ADVANCED WORK</h3>

            <p class="intro-text">Chris's keynotes are a great experience in and of themselves. Audiences love him, meeting planners are thrilled, and executives typically want more. That's always a good sign. To attend to that demand, we offer a series of follow up and follow on options that go with any of the core programs.</p>

            <div class="advanced-options">
                <div class="advanced-item">
                    <h4>½ Day add on:</h4>
                    <p>Following a keynote, you can have Chris stay for 1/2 day and meet with your executive team or any set of audience members that you choose. This affords your team the chance to get a deeper dive into the material, ask more questions, and explore the new world that Chris opened up for them.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-item">
                    <h4>Full day workshops:</h4>
                    <p>The keynote presentations are exciting, compelling, and stir up new ideas and thinking. However, by their nature they don't afford the time to truly immerse people into the rich material. You can book Chris and his team for day-long workshops and in that way provide your team with the chance to really explore the possibilities and profound implications of his work.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-item">
                    <h4>90-Day Embodiment Programs:</h4>
                    <p>One of the central tenants of Chris's work is that learning isn't about gaining insights, information, or understanding. It's about developing new ways of being and moving in the world. The end goal of his work is what we call Embodied Competence. Embodied means you can take new actions without have to refer to some book, manual or notes. They are your new automatic responses to the world. Competence is simply the capacity to consistently produce the desired result. There is only one way to produce Embodied Competence and that is via practice. No amount of understanding ever produced competence, only practice does that, and practice takes time.</p>

                    <p>For those that are serious about changing the culture in your organization we offer a series of 90-day implementation programs. These involve a series of coaching sessions, implementation assignments, and results tracking. This work is designed for teams as they are the operating units for today's business world.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="advanced-item">
                    <h4>Book Signing:</h4>
                    <p>Chris is not the sort of speaker who uses your platform to sell his programs or books. If you want to purchase books for your audience, he will happily stay and sign them for people. Audiences typically love this gesture on your part, and you get discounted pricing on lots of 100 or more!</p>
